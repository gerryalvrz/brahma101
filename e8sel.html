            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Anomaly #109 appears to be a standard vanilla ice cream that exhibits extraordinary healing properties when consumed. The substance has demonstrated the ability to repair physical damage to human tissue, including but not limited to: cuts, bruises, broken bones, and internal injuries.</p>
            <p><strong>Containment Procedures:</strong> Item is to be stored in a standard freezer unit at -18&#xb0;C (0&#xb0;F). No special containment procedures required beyond temperature control.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> High sugar content present (approximately 45g per 100g serving). Not recommended for diabetic individuals or those monitoring sugar intake. Healing properties remain effective regardless of dietary restrictions.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Testing has shown no adverse effects beyond those associated with regular ice cream consumption. Further research is ongoing to determine the mechanism behind its healing properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Anomaly #662 manifests as a pitch-black sphere that appears to absorb all light and heat from its surroundings. The entity exhibits properties of entropy acceleration and matter decay but becomes dangerously unstable when moved from its containment unit.</p>
            <p><strong>Containment Procedures:</strong> Entity must be contained in specialized chamber with dark matter stabilization field. Chamber location must maintain minimum 5km distance from Anomaly #661. Breach event triggers immediate evacuation protocol.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> CRITICAL: Proximity to Anomaly #661 strictly forbidden. Previous containment breach resulting in interaction caused [REDACTED] with estimated casualties of &#x2588;&#x2588;&#x2588;&#x2588;.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Anomaly #113 appears as a brass and copper mechanical device resembling an antique fortune-telling machine. When activated, it produces detailed written instructions that, when followed, demonstrably improve the user's future circumstances through probabilistic manipulation.</p>
            <p><strong>Containment Procedures:</strong> Device must be stored in high-security vault with biometric access controls. Usage strictly limited to three (3) times per individual. Detailed logs of all interactions mandatory. Medical team must be on standby during all authorized uses.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> CRITICAL: Usage beyond three times triggers lethal anomalous effect on next user, resulting in violent cardiac extraction. Multiple fatalities recorded from unauthorized fourth attempts. NO EXCEPTIONS TO THREE-USE LIMIT.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Recovery team discovered device in estate of deceased fortune teller. Investigation revealed pattern of successful predictions followed by client deaths. Research suggests machine operates by actively rewriting probability rather than simple precognition. Experiment logs indicate 100% success rate in improving user circumstances within designated parameters, but mechanism forcing three-use limit remains unclear.

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Anomaly #1503 manifests as a humanoid robotic entity wearing a camp ranger's outfit, carrying a glowing lantern and a sharpened walking stick. The entity demonstrates complex behavioral patterns focused on "guiding" Foundation personnel through darkened areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Containment Procedures:</strong> Entity must be contained in a reinforced chamber with constant illumination. During breach events, facility management must personally lead recovery efforts. Emergency lighting systems must be maintained at all times with redundant backup power.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> During containment breaches, entity exhibits aggressive behavior towards personnel who refuse its "guidance." Multiple fatalities have occurred through impalement with entity's walking stick when subjects attempted to decline assistance.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Entity appears to deliberately trigger power failures during breach events, creating conditions that align with its primary behavioral pattern. Despite hostile actions towards non-compliant personnel, entity demonstrates careful attention to successfully guiding compliant subjects through darkened areas.

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Anomaly #1505 initially manifests as a seemingly benevolent humanoid entity wearing medical scrubs and offering assistance to Foundation personnel. The entity demonstrates exceptional healing abilities and emotional support capabilities during its initial containment phase.</p>
            <p><strong>Containment Procedures:</strong> Entity must be contained in maximum security cell with reinforced steel walls and constant surveillance. No direct personnel contact permitted after Day 45 of containment. Remote monitoring only.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> SEVERE HAZARD. Entity undergoes dramatic behavioral shift after approximately 45 days of containment, revealing true hostile nature. Post-transformation casualties include [REDACTED] medical staff and [DATA EXPUNGED] research personnel.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Initial containment achieved through voluntary cooperation as entity requested Foundation protection. Transformation process begins with subtle personality changes before culminating in complete psychological inversion. Post-transformation abilities include but not limited to: cell membrane manipulation, targeted organ failure induction, and psychic assault.

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Anomaly #1506 manifests as an arachnid approximately 30cm in diameter composed entirely of transparent glass-like material. The entity demonstrates abilities of both a normal spider and properties of molten glass, including the ability to reshape itself and generate glass webbing that crystallizes at room temperature.</p>
            <p><strong>Containment Procedures:</strong> Entity must be contained in a reinforced terrarium maintained at precisely 20°C (68°F). Temperature fluctuations must be prevented as they trigger aggressive behavioral changes. Feeding schedule restricted to insects provided in sealed containers.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Entity becomes highly aggressive at temperatures above 25°C (77°F), demonstrating ability to produce molten glass projectiles. Multiple incidents of severe burns reported. At temperatures below 15°C (59°F), entity exhibits brittle properties but remains animate even if shattered.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> First discovered in an abandoned glassblowing studio following reports of "moving glass sculptures." Entity appears to consume silica-based materials to repair and expand its mass.

Entity demonstrates ability to autonomously attack those who exhibit fear of death, using their own past transgressions as a source of power. Multiple fatalities recorded during initial containment.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> First discovered in medieval monastery ruins following reports of spontaneous attacks on local population. Research suggests blade's composition changes based on accumulated "sins" of nearby individuals. Victims report experiencing vivid recollections of past transgressions during attacks.

            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> First discovered at a hospital where terminally ill patients reported miraculous recoveries after speaking with a "gentle woman in white." Entity claims to have once been cursed herself and now seeks to prevent others from suffering similar fates. Of particular interest is the entity's ability to identify genuine supernatural afflictions from natural ailments.
